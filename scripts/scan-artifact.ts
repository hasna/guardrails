/**
 * Scan the PACKED release artifact for bulk asset inventories.
 *
 * This is the `scan:artifact` release gate declared in hasna.contract.json
 * (metadata.release.artifactScan) and wired into prepack/prepublishOnly.
 * Run: bun run scan:artifact
 *
 * `contracts artifact-scan` takes a target and refuses to scan src/, so the
 * gate has to pack first — packing with --ignore-scripts, because the pack that
 * feeds the scan is itself triggered from prepack.
 *
 * The scanner version is pinned here and nowhere else. There is deliberately no
 * environment override: a gate whose command can be replaced at publish time is
 * the exact bypass the gate exists to close. tests/scan-artifact.test.ts asserts
 * the pin stays in lockstep with hasna.contract.json and the CI workflow.
