# open-guardrails

Reusable guardrail and policy decisions for agentic systems.

This project is intended to evaluate whether actions, prompts, shell commands,
MCP tool calls, browser/computer use, model routing, source access, secrets
access, and business operations should be allowed, denied, warned, redacted, or
approval-gated.

## Status

First useful OSS version: local-first TypeScript SDK, policy evaluator, CLI,
examples, and integration helper shapes for sibling open-* tools.

## Install

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun test
```

## CLI

```bash
guardrails evaluate \
  --policy examples/policies/starter.guardrails.json \
  --input examples/requests/destructive-shell-command.json \
  --json
```

Exit codes:

- `0`: allowed, warned, or redacted.
- `1`: denied or invalid input.
- `2`: approval required.

## SDK

```ts
import {
  defaultGuardrailPolicySet,
  evaluateGuardrail,
  openTerminalCommandGuardrailInput,
} from "@hasna/guardrails";

const input = openTerminalCommandGuardrailInput({
  command: "rm -rf ./tmp/generated-output",
  cwd: "/workspace/project",
  targetKind: "shell",
});

const decision = evaluateGuardrail(input, defaultGuardrailPolicySet);
```

## Decision Shape

Every decision includes:

- `status`: `allow`, `deny`, `warn`, `redact`, or `approval_required`.
- `reason`, the selected `matchedRule`, and all effective `matchedPolicies`.
- `rationaleTrace`, including each rule's match result, specificity, failed
  matcher groups, and selection rationale.
- `evidence`, `obligations`, `redactions`, and `approvalRequirements`.
- `audit` metadata with a deterministic decision id, policy set, operation
  type, actor, trace id, and labels. Pass `options.now` to include an evaluated
  time.

Matched rules are ranked by effect (`deny` > `approval_required` > `redact` >
`warn` > `allow`), then by the number and breadth of matcher constraints.
Policy id is the final deterministic tie-break.

## Examples

The starter policy covers:

- Secret redaction.
- Destructive shell command approval.
- Remote content piped to shell denial.
- Expensive model routing warnings.
- External-source trust warnings.
- High-impact business-action approval.

## Boundaries

Guardrails evaluate and decide. They do not execute actions, dispatch prompts,
run commands, call MCP tools, route models, or scan repositories.

- `open-actions` defines executable action contracts and previews.
- `open-security` owns security scanning and vulnerability/secret exposure
  workflows.
- `open-terminal`, `open-dispatch`, `open-mcps`, `open-gateway`, and
  `open-router` own their runtime mechanics and can call this package before
  execution.
